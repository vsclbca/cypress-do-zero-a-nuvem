# 🌲 Cypress, from zero to Cloud ☁️

This is a sample project, to learn how to create and execute tests in Cypress. It'll also be used to learn about Cypress Cloud and automated tests documentation creation.

In this project, you can run the tests on a desktop or mobile viewport.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm to clone and run this project.

> I have used versions '2.48.1', '22.14.0' and '10.9.2' of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

## Installation 

Run 'npm install' (or 'npm i' for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

In this test you can run the tests on a mobile or desktop viewport.

### Desktop 

Run 'npm run test' (or 'npm t' for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run 'npm run cy:open' to open the Cypress App on a desktop viewport.

### Mobile 

Run 'npm run test:mobile' to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, 'npm run cy:open:mobile' to open the Cypress App on a mobile viewport.
