It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

In this project, you can run the tests on a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop 

Run `npm run test` (or `npm run t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress App on a desktop viewport.

Or, run 'npm run cy:mobile' to open the Cypress App on a mobile viewport.
